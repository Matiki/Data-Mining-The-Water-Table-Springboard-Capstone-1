# Data-Mining-The-Water-Table-Springboard-Capstone-1
A repository for the first capstone project of the Springboard.com data science career track

Many rural communities around the world (especially in developing countries) rely on
water pumps as their main source of water. This includes water for drinking, cooking,
cleaning, growing crops, and more. Obviously if a community's water pump fails, it can
be extremely disruptive to daily life.

So the question is, how can we predict which water pumps are faulty, and which are
operational? Using data from the Tanzania Ministry of Water, we are going to make
predictions on which water pumps in rural Tanzania are functional, functional but in
need of repair, or non functional.

This project is part of a data science competition hosted by DrivenData.org, a non-profit 
organization which hosts competitions that have a social impact. It was submitted as the first capstone project of the Springboard curriculum.
